# Robofriends

This project was created while taking the React portion of the ZTM WebDev Course. This website fetches user data from [JsonPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and creates a random profile picture by passing a unique id with [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/) and displays the users information with a search window where you can look up the name of a user/friend
